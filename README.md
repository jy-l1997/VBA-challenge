Module 2 Challenge: VBA

In this, I took daily stock info (ticker, date, day open price, day close price, stock volume) and consolidated each stock to find yearly price change, yearly percent change, and total stock value over that year. I call that table the summary table

To make the numbers more readable, I colored the cells with positive price change/percent change green, and the cells with negative price change/percent change red.

After that, I continued summarizing the data and found the greatest percent increase, greatest percen decrease. I call that table the superlatives

For the sake of visual clarity, I adjusted the relevant number types of percentage and currency as well as formatted the cell sizes despite it not being required.
